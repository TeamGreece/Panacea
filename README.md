# Panacea
## _The Robot-Nurse!_
Panacea is Team Greece's project competing in the 2021 FIRST Global Challenge "Discover and Recover". 

## Features
Panacea can:
- Move autonomously in any space with the usage of SLAM algorithms
- Measure vital signs in real time, such as oxygen levels, blood pressure, temperature, etc.
- Disinfect rooms with the use of UVC lamps when they are empty

## Development

Panacea has been **designed, constructed** and **programmed** by students between _16 to 18_ years old from all around Greece, chosen based on their *knowledge*, *experience* and *love* for *robotics*. Due to the fact that it is not possible for all us to work together in real life, the prototype of panacea was constructed by the majority of the team *in a span of two weeks*. However, we plan on *improving the first design* so it can be a great fit in today's society. 

## Installation
Panacea **does not have an installation guide yet**, but we plan on making one *once the project is finished!* In the meantime, if you are interested, you can *check out the source code* for *ideas and inspiration* or to *give us feedback!*
